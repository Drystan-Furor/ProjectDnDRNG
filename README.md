reduce dnd prep time with custom built generator

If you ever played D&D you might have noticed this does not go without social encounters. Being a Dungeon Master (DM) is a challenge. 
We have to take time and prepare a game session, but we cannot prepare everything that happens, so sometimes we improvise. 
However, with great improvisation comes great responsibility: details.

Trough personal experience I realized that things would be easier making lists of details and using dice to randomly decide what details would fill my blanks.
So I set out to write one page after another with random details that do not impact the story of a DM, like a D100 List: Familiar Behavior
This led me to a marvellous website with more D100 lists.

After learning to write code based on my personal development plan, I realized I could use code to make more D100 lists beyond the scope of 100,
and if I would write the code I would no longer need books, notes, notepads or dices to prepare details. 
No longer would I remain inspiration-less or bland when my players would meet a new character.
Inmagine, with one click of the mouse, a script would roll all dices and combine all results into a small text block, 
reading it out loud would give a detailed, unqique yet fully randomized NPC. So next time my party walks into a tavern and ask the DM what people are inside, 
we don't have to come up on the spot with a memorable or less memorable character. Click the button and see who they meet!

It is a work in progress, for now it generates :

a random race
sometimes with a little background information.
NPC's get a name according to race lore, adhering to WotC's idea's where possible,
otherwise it generates a random name by lore naming conventions shared by Forgotten Realms.
Any and all races are optimalized for their ages, in a range between the stages of a child and whatever is a race specific maximum age.
The generator gives a description of the NPC's
eyes
nose
chin
lips
teeth
There is a randomly chosen mood
If there are noticble scars or wounds visible.
The amount of wealth is determined and based off that a fitting wardrobe is applied
sometimes they even wear a hat.
Most npc's usually have some form of trinket or jewel
and each one carries a random weapon.
there is Drow support, even though it's not a race on the list.
